Unreleased
==========

This page was built for Silex |silex-release| on the |docs-channel|
documentation channel.

It records user-visible changes since the development workflow moved to task
branches; earlier post-0.1.1 changes are not yet listed here.  Listed entries
are available on the ``dev`` channel and become the next release's notes when
that release is prepared.

Fixed
-----

- ``roots_of_unity`` and ``root_of_unity_order`` no longer return a
  wrong ``w``.  ``Q(zeta_9)`` previously gave ``w = 6``, where the true value
  is 18, which made ``zeta_class_regulator_product`` three times too small.
  The search now builds prime-power roots of unity up to the good-prime bound
  and returns ``w`` only when it certifies a root of unity of exactly that
  order.  In every other case it fails.  Cyclotomic fields defined by
  (translates of) cyclotomic polynomials, such as ``Q(zeta_7)``, which
  previously failed, are now supported.  See "Roots of unity" in
  :doc:`../reference/algorithms_and_sources`.

- ``Element::is_power`` and ``Element::is_square`` now find non-integral roots
  that were previously reported as unsupported, for example
  ``((3 + 4i) / 5)^3`` in ``Q(i)``.  A non-integral input is rescaled by its
  power-basis denominator before the root is lifted, and the root is scaled
  back and verified exactly.  Answers for algebraic integers are unchanged.
  See "Element powers and roots" in :doc:`../reference/algorithms_and_sources`.
- ``OrderUnitGroup::class_regulator_index_bound`` now returns ``false`` when
  the upper endpoint of ``h_cand R_cand / hR`` is below one, instead of
  reporting an index of one.  No positive integer index is consistent with
  such an analytic value.  See :doc:`../reference/class_units_compact`.
- Unit saturation proofs now enlarge a unit that is an ``ell``-th power only
  up to torsion, such as ``-(3 + 2 sqrt2) = -(1 + sqrt2)^2`` at ``ell = 2``
  in ``Q(sqrt2)``.  Such cases previously failed closed.  Candidate roots now
  include the torsion generator, and verification still requires an empty
  torsion-extended kernel.
- ``zeta_residue_bf_audit`` and ``zeta_class_regulator_product_bf_audit`` now
  leave every output unchanged when they fail.  Every BF audit API now writes
  the value last, so a call that passes the same ``Arb`` for the value and the
  error bound receives the value.  A
  ``max_cutoff`` near ``UWORD_MAX`` is now accepted, where it previously
  wrapped and made every call fail.  See :doc:`../reference/factored_zeta`.
